# javascript-beginners-projects
## hello world
in this repo I'll work on some simple projects in range beginners-intermediate level, in every folder, you will find `index.html` for **html** file (wow, like you didn't know) **css** and **Js** files. in case you want to take the challenge and make it before you saw the code then you have to read the `README.md` file, It's a description of the project and how it'll be like
>it's not necessary to have the same code as mine, maybe yours is cleaner, and don't focus on that now ***Just make it works***

## usage
to download and see all the projects on your local machine then
>you are a coder, then I'll explain the CLI methode (wow, like you didn't know that ðŸ˜‘)

* install `Git` and `node` in your local machin
* oprn **git bash**, **CMD** or whatever and add the commands bellow
* cd (add the path of where you want to download the repo)
* `git clone git@github.com:CH4R4F/javascript-beginners-projects.git`
* cd javascript-beginners-projects

now you can open the folder on VScode or whatever and read or edit them
I'll add new projects when I have some ideas or if you have ones then send a pull request

**Notes**
those projects may not be responsive, it's because i'm focusing on the Js part not media queries
and remember, just make it works fine
