# Javascript Beginners Projects

## About

In this repo I'll work on some simple projects in range from beginners to intermediate level. In each folder, you will find an `index.html` file and some **CSS** and **JS** files. In case you want to take the challenge and make it before you saw the code then you have to read the `description.md` file. It's a description of the project and what it'll be like.

It's not necessary to have the same code as mine, maybe yours is cleaner, and don't focus on that now. _Just make it work_.

## Usage

To download and see all the projects on your local machine:

1. Install Git and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. Open a terminal tab.
1. Navigate to where you want to clone this repo
1. Clone it.
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:CH4R4F/javascript-beginners-projects.git
    cd javascript-beginners-projects
    ```

Now you can open the folder in VS Code or whatever and read or edit the projects.

I'll add new projects when I have some ideas or if you have ones then send a Pull Request.

## Notes

These projects may not be responsive for mobile devices. As I'm focusing on the JS part, not CSS media queries. You should focus too on getting the JS part to work.
